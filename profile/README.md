## Overview

The Pencil Tech Project is composed of three interconnected applications that work together to streamline teacher support services:

1. **Shopping App:** A user-friendly platform for teachers to browse, select, and order classroom supplies available at the Pencil Box.
2. **Scheduling App:** A scheduling tool that replaces traditional systems like Calendly, allowing teachers to book shopping times and giving administrators powerful reporting capabilities.
3. **Inventory Management System:** A backend solution that keeps track of stock and ties the shopping and scheduling apps together.
